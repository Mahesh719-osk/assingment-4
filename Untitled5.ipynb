    "# Encapsulation: The concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation also includes restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is often done using access modifiers like private, public, or protected.\n",

It can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name exist but differ in parameters)."
